# Northcoders News API
Welcome to my prototype News website.
This project was built in two phases.

Phase 1: Backend Development
• API Development: Built a robust API using JavaScript and PostgreSQL to programmatically access and manipulate application data, emulating a real-world backend service.
• Comprehensive Endpoints: Implemented multiple endpoints including retrieving topics, articles, and users, as well as managing comments and article data with CRUD operations.
  Endpoints can be accessed here - https://news-that-matters.onrender.com/api/
• Version Control: Ensured structured development with Git branching and pull requests, supported by Husky pre-commit hooks to maintain code integrity.

Phase 2: Frontend Development
• React Frontend: Developed a responsive and interactive React-based frontend, enabling users to view, vote, and comment on articles, integrated seamlessly with the backend API.
• User Experience & Deployment: Focused on user-friendly interface design, error handling, and successful deployment on Netlify, ensuring a smooth and reliable user experience.
