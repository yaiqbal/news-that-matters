# Northcoders News Website

Welcome to the Northcoders News website! This project is a full-stack news application showcasing the integration of backend API's with a frontend application. Users can view, filter, comment on, upvote, and downvote articles seamlessly.

## Project Overview

This project was built in two phases, focusing on backend API development and frontend application integration. The result is a fully functional news browsing platform with various interactive features.

### Phase 1: Backend Development

The backend phase involved setting up robust API's to handle data operations and provide endpoints for the frontend.

- **API Development:** Built using JavaScript and PostgreSQL to programmatically access and manipulate application data.
- **Comprehensive Endpoints:** Implemented multiple endpoints for retrieving topics, articles, users, and managing comments and article data with CRUD operations. [API Endpoints](https://news-that-matters.onrender.com/api/)
- **Version Control:** Utilized Git branching and pull requests, supported by Husky pre-commit hooks to maintain code integrity.

### Phase 2: Frontend Development

The frontend phase focused on creating a responsive, user-friendly interface that interacts seamlessly with the backend API.

- **React Frontend:** Developed a responsive and interactive React-based frontend, enabling users to view, vote, and comment on articles.
- **User Experience & Deployment:** Focused on user-friendly interface design, error handling, and successful deployment on Netlify.
